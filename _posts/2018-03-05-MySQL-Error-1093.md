## Error
- `1093 - You can't specify target table 'story_category' for update in FROM clause`
- Unlike Oracle, MySQL can not directly use the data of its own table in UPDATE or DELETE, so when executing the following SQL, 1093 error occurs.

## Error Example
```sql
DELETE
FROM room
WHERE idx IN (
  SELECT DISTINCT R.id as idx
  FROM room R
  LEFT JOIN groups G ON R.id=G.rid
  WHERE isnull(G.rid)
)
 ```

## Handling
- Fixed by creating a temporary table by inserting another Subquery

```sql
DELETE
FROM room
WHERE idx IN (
  SELECT idx
  FROM (
    SELECT DISTINCT R.id as idx
    FROM room R
    LEFT JOIN groups G ON R.id=G.rid
    WHERE isnull(G.rid)
  ) temp
);
 ```
